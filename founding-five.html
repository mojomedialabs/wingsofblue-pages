    <div id="James-Joseph-Davis-III">Jim finally saw the light after a wasted childhood as a Navy brat and headed for the wilds of Colorado. Here he has divided his time between studies and sleep with studies winning by a wide margin. Working hard until the last, Jim finally eased up and ordered a new Sting Ray. His Navy heritage calls for a girl in every port. In spite of a summer at Fort Benning, this confirmed Bachelor should go far. He hopes to begin with pilot training at Moody.</div>
    <div id="Jay-Wilford-Kelly">Ole "Foose" hails from Hoosier Land and in '59 decided to try his luck in the Air Force. After a stay at Lackland AFB, he was sent to NAPS at Bainbridge, Maryland and from thence to the Wild West and the AFA. Being an avid supporter of sky diving and a member of the semi-official Academy sky diving team, sky diving and a nurse in Denver, along with being "exec" of Friendly First Squadron, occupied most of his time as a "firstie". He plans a June wedding and a missile career</div>
    <div id="Stuart-Boardman-McCurdy">This staunch Yankee from the huge state of Rhode Island never missed a chance to toss a jibe at his rebel contemporaries. Between his many duties on Third Group Staff and his activities of judo and sky diving, it's a real wonder how he finished ahead of the Dean and his boys. Stu's still wondering! After graduation and a long leave in Europe, Stu will turn the nose of his Sting Ray toward Laredo AFB, where he is looking forward to beating his brother's fine record at pilot training.</div>

    <div id="Lance-Peter-Sijan"> Sy, a native of "old" Milwaukee, Wisconsin, came to the Academy well prepared for his career as a cadet. He attended prep school at Bainbridge, Maryland, the Navy Prep School for Annapolis, and came here well rounded in military bearing and athletic prowess. Lance earned the respect of his classmates by adhering to that quotation "when the going gets tough, the tough get going". He demonstrated this by fighting the Dean's academic program during much of his "free" time. His accomplishments include three years varsity football, the Commandant's Merit List, the Photo Club, the Sky Diving Club, and the TALON Staff as the photo editor.</div>
