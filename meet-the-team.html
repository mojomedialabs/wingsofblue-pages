          I used to compete as a sprinter in track and field for the Air Force Academy, but then I decided that jumping out of planes was exponentially more fun than running in circles.

            Why did you join the team:

          To pass on the gift that was given to me.  It is something special to take your students from knowing nothing, to spitting out emergency procedures while spun and distracted, to watching them fall away from the plane with a look of overwhelming terror and extreme excitement, to seeing their pride after pinning on the jump wings.   The whole experience is as unique as it is extrordinary.

          </span>
          The most fun jump I've had was from a hot air balloon. But my favorite skydiving experience was when my mom, sister, brother, and girlfriend (at the time) did tandems and I got to be on the ground waiting for them and got to see how excited they were!

          I love doing risky, dangerous things, so naturally skydiving is one of my top activities. Falling towards the earth, knowing your life is completely in your hands is one helluva thrill!

            Why did you join the team:
          </span>
          I wanted to give back to the program that gave me so much. I wanted to be able to "help" kids out the plane and see the vast spectrum of emotions ranging from fear to pure joy all in a span of 2 seconds. I wanted to be able to help motivate kids so much that they would be willing to throw themselves out of a plane despite an innate desire not to. Also, after seeing the camaraderie within the team, I wanted to be able to partake in that and share the same bond with a great bunch of guys and girls.

            Favorite Jump:
          </span>
          Spring Break 2010 - We jumped at Cape Canaveral, FL. This was the first time we got to jump at a location other than USAFA, wearing chuck taylor's, with more than 1 WoG on a pass, over the water, overlooking the NASA space center. To top it all off we got an awesome speech from an awesome staff member which really set the tone for the trip. This was by far my fondest jump memory.

            Why did you join the team:
          </span>
          Life time frendship. Opportunity to share your knowledge to others. I want to be a positive influence for those around me. I love sharing the stories on how a little kid, a nobody from Madagascar who barely spoke english in 2008 applied for an appointment to the Air Force Academy. A year later, he went through the jump program AM 490 and then tried out for the Wings of Green. Now he is part of the World Class team Wings of Blue. I want to convey through this story that the impossible could be possible and dreams can come true. I wanna encourage others to work towards their goals and their dreams because nothing is impossible. Teaching AM 490 would give me the opportunity to share such story.
