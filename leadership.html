      <li><span class="question">Hometown:</span>Grand Prairie, TX</li>
      <li><span class="question">Squadron Position:</span>Commander</li>
      <li><span class="question">Career Highlights:</span>Casual Lt in the 94 ATS (when there was just a jump flight); flying the B-1B, T-38, and F-15C; returning to the 98 FTS as Ops Officer and then Commander</li>
      <li><span class="question">Biggest Motivation Behind Working at the 98th FTS:</span>It’s been such a blessing to return to the team that meant so much to me as a cadet and getting a chance to try and make things better for current/future cadets.  There is no better cadet leadership laboratory than our parachuting programs and I’m glad to be part of it again.</li>
      <li><span class="question">Favorite Jump:</span>My first AFF-I jump with C2C Zach Mills and jumping into Mile High Stadium with my 4-way team as a cadet.</li>
      <li><span class="question">Why you enjoy jumping:</span>It really is “flight in its purest form”…stand in the door!</li>
      <li><span class="question">Outside Jumping (What you Do):</span>Spend as much time as I can with my family: wife Mauri, sons Brody and Braden, and daughter Brenna. </li>
