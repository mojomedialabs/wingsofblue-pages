        <a class="email" href="mailto:glenn.paluch@wingsofblue.com">glenn.paluch@wingsofblue.com</a>
            <span class="bio"><p>Glenn Paluch may not have the traditional background commonly associated with the finest skydiving/parachute team in the world, but he does have what it takes to make a difference. Glenn serves the Wings of Blue Association as the only board member that was not a PTWOB, did not attend the Air Force Academy (it was Texas A&M) and was not a member of the U.S. Air Force.  He has zero free-fall jumps and two tandem jumps (a long time ago).  Born and raised an Air Force brat, the Paluch family currently supports ten cadets through the Academy’s Cadet Sponsor program.</p>
            <p>With all of the recent budget constraints and military spending cuts, Glenn noticed a need to help support the Wings of Blue team, which runs the Air Force basic free-fall course, AM490. With help from Lt. Col. Matt Rytting and Cadet Ryan Fantasia, Glenn was able to create this 501(c)(3) to support its mission.</p> 
            <p>As co-founder and president of the Wings of Blue Association, he has been instrumental in establishing, developing and overseeing the day-to-day operations, management and overall direction of the Association. Glenn is also responsible for securing and meeting the fundraising goals needed to properly aid Wings of Blue.</p>
            <p>In addition to his work for the Association, Glenn is president of Summit Mercantile, a sales, marketing and consulting organization serving the home furnishings industry in the retail, interior design and contract distribution channels.</p>
            <p>In his free time, he serves as Pack Committee Chair for Cub Scout Pack 17 – a group of over 110 active boys and 38 adult volunteers –  in Monument, CO.</p>
            <p>Glenn and his wife Regan have two sons, Zach (9) and Henry (7).</p></span>

            <p>Captivated by Alaska, Matt moved north to Fairbanks to lead a team establishing Advanced Programs capabilities at RED FLAG-Alaska, a realistic 10-day air combat training exercise. As a volunteer Civil Air Patrol squadron commander, he integrated CAP aircraft into RED FLAG scenarios, providing low and slow intercept targets to fighter aircrews. In 2009, Big Brothers Big Sisters honored him as a Fairbanks Big Brother of the Year.</p>
            <p>Matt recently served as Director of Operations for the Wings of Blue and currently performs duties as an Air Force One Advance Agent.</p></span>
